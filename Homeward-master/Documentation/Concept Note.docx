Concept Note

Problem
In the last half century, the world has seen 46 major incidents that have displaced at least 151 million people. From World War II to decolonization movements, from ethnic cleansing to war, the last 75 years of our history have seen unprecedented numbers of people flee their homes out of fear for their own life. These numbers also fail to take into account those who flee for environmental reasons, such as drought and famine, or even those that are internally displaced - forced to flee their homes but unable to cross an international border.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that only between 1 - 2% of refugees are resettled to a new country in the year they flee their homes. Lengthy processing times, document verification, security concerns and assessments of integration, along with public opinion, all hinder resettlement efforts and can cost lives and dignity and hope.

Resettlement is a life-changing experience, and yet families have little to no choice on where they are sent - often to a country where the society, language and culture are completely different and new to them. Additionally, refugees often lack information on what their futures might look like in a new country. For example, architects, engineers, lawyers and doctors might find themselves ineligible to practice their trades, ultimately negatively affecting their future financial security upon integration. This approach erodes human potential, and focuses exclusively on the displaced personâ€™s vulnerabilities, rather than their assets and futures. Inevitably, many of the refugees affected by this blatant lack of autonomy and dignity quickly become disillusioned, which may lead to a lengthened journey of return or worse, to a failure to integrate, leaving many in permanent limbo.

In truth, refugee-friendly policies are viewed mostly as both a moral imperative and a choice - ironic considering even countries with unfriendly policies have more open and active immigration systems. That is precisely why our team has opted to create a solution that brings back the humanity to the way the world currently approaches the vast numbers of displaced persons. We choose to view refugees as people with the potential skills, resources, and knowledge that rather than burden, contribute to country economies and futures.

Concept
Homeward* is a platform enabled by Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and IOT. It aims at transforming the UNHCR country referral process into a full-fledged immigration matrix that matches refugees with the cities and countries that will best provide them with the opportunity to rebuild their lives with dignity.

Our platform focuses on five (5) key factors, in addition to country quotas, to measure the potential success of reintegration:
Family & Community
Education & Certification Validity
Professional Experience & Capabilities
Language
Cultural & Religious Preferences

Homeward uses identity management and verification mechanisms to securely evaluate and track the five (5) key factors to render an ideal match for refugees.

Why Blockchain?
Blockchain technologies provide us with unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize the way that refugees are processed within complex international systems. User data, kept safe and private, can help provide refugees with permanent legal identification that travel through their screening processes and provide invaluable needs assessments as well as insight into how to best place them into new countries. Furthermore, blockchain provides an opportunity to record and retain important information refugees generally are unable to travel with - academic and professional backgrounds, medical information, etc. Our platform will cross reference each of the data points we collect and yield ranked suggestions for country referral.
